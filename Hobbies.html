    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>I like playing sport, all kinds, but mainly: <ol>
        <li>Tennis</li>
        <li>Road Cycling</li>
        <li>Football</li>
        <li>Cricket</li>
        <p>...but I'm always up for anything, as long as I've got a chance of winning!</p>
      </ol>
    </li>
      <li>I'm also a big watcher of sport, will watch basically anything (although I wasn;t a big fan of the Finger Knitting
        World Championships), but mainly:<ol>
        <li>Football</li>
        <li>Tennis</li>
        <li>Cricket</li>
        <li>Cycling</li>
        <li>American Football</li>
        <li>Athletics</li>
        <li>Snooker</li>
        <li>Darts</li>
      </ol>
    </li> <br>
    <li>Aside from sport, I also like reading, both interesting non-fiction books, as well as a gripping novel.</li>
    <li>I also enjoy travelling, both a road trip in the United Kingdom, as well as an adventure to explore somewhere new around the world,
      whether that is a new city or an adrenaline-fuelled activity.</li>
    <li>As an Orthodox Jew, I also spend time immersed in religious study, whether that is learning the Talmud or Bible, or a exegesis on the topic,
      or something else related. <br> I attend a class twice a week on the Talmud, and spend time each evening with someone else reviewing the previous
      class or preparing for the next one.</li>
